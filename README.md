- Selects a loadout for the game
- Presses random keys during the game
- Ends the game and goes back to the home screen
- Restart an another game

## Notes

- The script uses image recognition to locate buttons and menus on the screen. If the images used in the script do not match the images in the game, the script may not work properly.
- Make sure your game is running in fullscreen mode 1920x1080 in english and that the UI is not obstructed by any other windows.
- The script presses random keys during the game. This may not be optimal for gameplay, and it is recommended to modify the script to press specific keys instead.
